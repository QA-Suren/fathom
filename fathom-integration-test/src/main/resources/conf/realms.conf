# Realms.
#
# A Realm is an Account provider used during the Authentication process.
#
# Aside from validating credentials, Realms may also provide Account
# metadata such as full name, email addresses, Roles, & Permissions.
#
# Usernames are the key identifier for a Realm.  If a username exists in
# multiple realms, an aggregate Account is built from the metadata, roles,
# and permissions of each realm Account.
